# Building
This disassembly is for the [cc65 toolchain](https://cc65.github.io/), and requires make (e.g. for Windows: [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)). Banks 0-3, as well as the level data portion of bank 5, are taken from a copy of the original game ROM. From the command line:
- US: `make BASE_ROM=path_to_original_mm_rom us`
- Japan: `make BASE_ROM=path_to_original_rm_rom japan`

Rest of readme to be written
